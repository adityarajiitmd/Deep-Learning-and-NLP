This will contain my notes on mixture of experts 



"Mixture of Experts is a neural network architecture that divides the learning task into multiple sub-tasks, assigning each to a specialized expert. These experts operate independently and contribute to the final prediction through a gating mechanism. This allows the model to adaptively choose which expert or combination of experts to rely on, enhancing its ability to handle diverse and intricate datasets."
